Content: Hi all!

This is a reminder that we will be hosting our open house meeting (with treats!!) today (Wednesday, September 4th) from 7:30-9pm in WLH 119. This is for all who are interested in UDL but have not yet had a chance to learn more about it. Please text me (612-500-3076) if you have trouble finding it!

This will be our last informational event, but if you are interested in joining and haven't been able to make it to any of these sessions, no worries! You can sign up for a coffee chat here, or reply to this email and we will loop you in.

Lastly, if you were able to come to our cookie night or have already been added to the coaching list, no need to attend tomorrow's open house :)

See you all tomorrow!
Skylar Wang and Dylan Bober (UDL co-presidents)
