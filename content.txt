"Heyyyy,\n\nIt's been forever! So we\u2019re having a few friends over at my place this Friday night, starting around 8 PM. Nothing big\u2014just hanging out, sipping on some drinks, maybe some impromptu karaoke if we\u2019re feeling it. We\u2019ll be chilling at my place, 123 Chill Lane, you know the spot! Come through whenever you\u2019re free.\n\nBring some snacks, or just show up\u2014no stress! Wanna give me a heads-up if you\u2019re coming? Here\u2019s the RSVP link: I'm in!\n\nSee ya then!\nJoey"
